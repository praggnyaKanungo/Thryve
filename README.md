# Thryve: Digital Farming App

## Description:
  ### Thryve is a multiplayer virtual farming app that promotes social awareness for sustainable farming methods in the real world. Players choose from seven global farming regions—USA, Europe, South America, South Asia, East Asia, Australia, and Africa—and manage crops over a three-month harvest period. Starting with an initial budget based on their selected farm size--small ($10,000), medium ($25,000), or large ($50,000)--users are challenged to implement eco-friendly farming techniques. 
  ### After each successful harvest, Thryve donates a portion of its earnings to a non-profit organization supporting sustainable agriculture, encouraging players to engage with both the virtual and real-world impacts of responsible farming practices.
